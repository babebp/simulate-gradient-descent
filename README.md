# Iris Datasets Gradient Descent Visualization
This project visualizes the gradient descent algorithm applied to a classification model using the Iris dataset. The objective is to demonstrate how gradient descent optimizes model parameters to predict flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. The visualizations show how the algorithm converges during each iteration.

### Features
- 📊 Gradient Descent Visualization: Displays how the algorithm converges to the optimal solution during each iteration.
- 🖼️ Data Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to create visualizations of the gradient descent path.
- 📑 Iris Dataset: Utilizes the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of flowers from three different species.
